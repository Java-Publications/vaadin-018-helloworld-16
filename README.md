# Backend meets Frontend: Test UI elements individually
We go deeper into testing the UI. Our goal is to test individual UI components individually. And with as little effort as possible, so that it does not become cumbersome even with a larger application and we quickly get feedback on our changes.


## How to start
To play with this you only have to start the main - method from the class  ```org.rapidpm.vaadin.helloworld.server.Main``` and 
go with your browser to the address: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

Ok, you got your first Vaadin "Hello World".
